  'Jessica DiCarlo, PhD is an Assistant Professor at the School of Environment, Society, and Sustainability and Affiliated Faculty in Environmental Humanities and Asian Studies. A human geographer and social scientist, her research focuses on issues of inequity, resource politics, global China, and geopolitics. In her housing research, she is currently collecting interviews for an oral history project entitled Housing Insecurity and Justice in Utah (Co-PI with Kate Malaia). The project examines dimensions of housing insecurity, including socio-economic pressures, age, ability, health pressures, immigration status, inequality, subpar housing conditions, and problematic rental laws. To conduct this study, we collaborate with local community organizations, employing predominantly qualitative methods such as resident interviews and spatial mapping to gain insights into the lived experiences of those affected by housing challenges.'

  'Housing Insecurity in Utah is a multidisciplinary pilot research project that explores the lived experiences of housing instability in the Salt Lake Valley. Amid Utah’s rapid growth and rising housing costs, many residents, especially vulnerable populations, face unsafe, unstable, and unaffordable living conditions. This project goes beyond affordability to investigate how housing insecurity intersects with environmental hazards, systemic policy failures, and social injustice. Through oral histories, interviews, and visual documentation of residential spaces, the project highlights how people cope with precarious housing—often in spaces that are overlooked by conventional housing research. In particular, we pay attention to “in-between” situations where people are not homeless but lack secure, stable, or safe homes. Key groups include refugees and immigrants, formerly incarcerated individuals, linguistically isolated communities, university students, and those in short-term housing. Combining approaches from human geography, architecture, planning, and environmental studies, the project reveals how housing insecurity disrupts daily life, deepens inequality, and exposes people to environmental risks. Ultimately, it seeks to link personal experiences with broader systems, offering a justice-oriented view of the housing crisis in Utah.'
